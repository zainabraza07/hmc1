  <h2>About HMC</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>Hiking & Mountaineering Club (HMC)</strong> holds a prestigious position among
    university-level societies due to its unique nature of activities and active participation
    in outdoor adventures.
  </p>

  <p>
    Established in <strong>1901</strong>, the club initially worked under the Sports Board and
    remained affiliated with the Rovers Club. Over time, HMC has evolved into a separate and
    independent university-level society, proudly carrying its own identity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since the inception of mankind, humans have engraved their fate on the stones of hardship
    and despair. This perpetual endeavor reflects an innate curiosity to explore the unknown.
    HMC exists to guide and train students to meet adventures and challenges in nature with
    courage, resilience, and leadership.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the snow-covered peaks of the <strong>Himalayas</strong> to the rolling sands of
    <strong>Cholistan</strong>, the Hiking & Mountaineering Club proudly hoists the university flag.
